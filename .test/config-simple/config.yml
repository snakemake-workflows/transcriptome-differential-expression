# Differential Isoform Analysis

# The differential isoform analysis pipeline uses FLAIR and includes resource-intensive computations and only works with additional constraints.
#     1. In 'samples.csv: The 'condition' column must contain exactly two distinct values. For example 'control' and 'treated'.
#     2. In 'samples.csv: Refrain from using underscores when naming samples. The 'sample' column may contain underscores, but be aware that underscores will be removed from the name for isoform quantification steps.
#     3. In this file: the variable 'isoform_analysis' below must be:'"yes"'. This is a check to determine if users are aware of the constraints and wish to proceed.
FLAIR:
    # Perform Differential Isoform Analysis with FLAIR?

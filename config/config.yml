# The alternative hypothesis for computing wald p-values. By default, 
# the normal Wald test assesses deviation of the estimated log fold 
# change from the null hypothesis, as given by lfc_null. 
# One of ["greaterAbs", "lessAbs", "greater", "less"] or None. 
# The alternative hypothesis corresponds to what the user wants to 
# find rather than the null hypothesis. (default: None).

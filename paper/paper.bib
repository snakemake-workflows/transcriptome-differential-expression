	abstract = {The evolution to network and computational paradigm has gone through a amazing phase of expansion and development. The growth curve was indeed very steep in many major domains. The advent of Cloud computing \& Machine learning has enhanced the implementation in application area like Bioinformatics. With huge application-domain scope Cloud computing has emerged as a special area of interest for many bioinformatics researchers. Research is being done on different aspects of Cloud computing with bioinformatics for identifying areas of improvement and their respective remedies for living beings. Specially the cloud computing are acting very helpful for identifying H1N1 virus in human. H1N1 is an infectious virus which, when spread affects a large volume of the population. It spreads very easily and has a high death rate. Similarly cloud computing doing good job for detection of Hypertension, Diabetics, Cancer and Heart patient with software as a service, so the development of healthcare support systems using cloud computing is emerging as an effective solution with the benefits of better quality of service, reduced costs. This paper, provide an effective review towards cloud computing important effort in a field of bioinformatics.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and the concomitant reduction in sequencing costs allows unprecedented high throughput profiling of biological systems in a cost-efficient manner. Modern biological experiments are increasingly becoming both data and computationally intensive and the wealth of publicly available biological data is introducing bioinformatics into the “Big Data” era. For these reasons, the effective application of High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures is becoming progressively more recognized also by bioinformaticians. Here we describe HPC resources provisioning pilot programs dedicated to bioinformaticians, run by the Italian Node of ELIXIR (ELIXIR-IT) in collaboration with CINECA, the main Italian supercomputing center. Results Starting from April 2016, CINECA and ELIXIR-IT launched the pilot Call “ELIXIR-IT HPC@CINECA”, offering streamlined access to HPC resources for bioinformatics. Resources are made available either through web front-ends to dedicated workflows developed at CINECA or by providing direct access to the High Performance Computing systems through a standard command-line interface tailored for bioinformatics data analysis. This allows to offer to the biomedical research community a production scale environment, continuously updated with the latest available versions of publicly available reference datasets and bioinformatic tools. Currently, 63 research projects have gained access to the HPC@CINECA program, for a total handout of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 8 Millions of CPU/hours and, for data storage, {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 100 TB of permanent and {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 300 TB of temporary space. Conclusions Three years after the beginning of the ELIXIR-IT HPC@CINECA program, we can appreciate its impact over the Italian bioinformatics community and draw some considerations. Several Italian researchers who applied to the program have gained access to one of the top-ranking public scientific supercomputing facilities in Europe. Those investigators had the opportunity to sensibly reduce computational turnaround times in their research projects and to process massive amounts of data, pursuing research approaches that would have been otherwise difficult or impossible to undertake. Moreover, by taking advantage of the wealth of documentation and training material provided by CINECA, participants had the opportunity to improve their skills in the usage of HPC systems and be better positioned to apply to similar EU programs of greater scale, such as PRACE. To illustrate the effective usage and impact of the resources awarded by the program - in different research applications - we report five successful use cases, which have already published their findings in peer-reviewed journals.},

	abstract = {Good self-control has been linked to adaptive outcomes such as better health, cohesive personal relationships, success in the workplace and at school, and less susceptibility to crime and addictions. In contrast, self-control failure is linked to maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting better regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding self-control is the strength or resource depletion model. Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource that becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting in self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which people completing an initial self-control task have reduced self-control capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent task, a state known as ego depletion. Although a meta-analysis of ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence of the effect and identified instances of possible bias. The analyses served as a catalyst for the current Registered Replication Report of the ego-depletion effect. Multiple laboratories ( k = 23, total N = 2,141) conducted replications of a standardized ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task paradigm by Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed that the size of the ego-depletion effect was small with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) that encompassed zero ( d = 0.04, 95\% CI [−0.07, 0.15]. We discuss implications of the findings for the ego-depletion effect and the resource depletion model of self-control.},

Thus this study serves as a test of whether the findings in the earlier studies were specific to certain institutions, student cohorts, and programming languages. Also, we used a non-parametric approach to the analysis, rather than the linear approach of earlier studies. Our results are consistent with the earlier studies.

	abstract = {Background : Knowing the needs of the bioimaging community with respect to research data management (RDM) is essential for identifying measures that enable adoption of the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for microscopy and bioimage analysis data across disciplines. As an initiative within Germany's National Research Data Infrastructure, we conducted this community survey in summer 2021 to assess the state of the art of bioimaging RDM and the community needs. Methods : An online survey was conducted with a mixed question-type design. We created a questionnaire tailored to relevant topics of the bioimaging community, including specific questions on bioimaging methods and bioimage analysis, as well as more general questions on RDM principles and tools. 203 survey entries were included in the analysis covering the perspectives from various life and biomedical science disciplines and from participants at different career levels. Results : The results highlight the importance and value of bioimaging RDM and data sharing. However, the practical implementation of FAIR practices is impeded by technical hurdles, lack of knowledge, and insecurity about the legal aspects of data sharing. The survey participants request metadata guidelines and annotation tools and endorse the usage of image data management platforms. At present, OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects) is the best known and most widely used platform. Most respondents rely on image processing and analysis, which they regard as the most time-consuming step of the bioimage data workflow. While knowledge about and implementation of electronic lab notebooks and data management plans is limited, respondents acknowledge their potential value for data handling and publication. Conclusion : The bioimaging community acknowledges and endorses the value of RDM and data sharing. Still, there is a need for information, guidance, and standardization to foster the adoption of FAIR data handling. This survey may help inspiring targeted measures to close this gap.},

They have a wide range of toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, neuronal toxicity, and carcinogenesis. Yet, biological targets responsible for these effects are not well addressed. Using methods of computational biology for target identification, we tested more than 200 PAs. We used a machine-learning approach that applies structural similarity for target identification, ChemMapper, and SwissTargetPrediction. The predicted targets with high probabilities were muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1. The predicted interactions between these two targets and PAs were further studied by molecular docking-based binding energies using AutoDock and VinaLC, which revealed good binding affinities. The PAs are bound to the same binding pocket as pirenzepine, a known M1 antagonist. These results were confirmed by in vitro assays showing that PAs increased the levels of intracellular calcium. We conclude that PAs are potential acetylcholine receptor M1 antagonists. This elucidates for the first time the serious neuro-oncological toxicities exerted by PA consumption.},

Since the end of the year 2019, COVID-19 threatens the world as a rapidly spreading infectious disease. For this work, we targeted the non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) as a key protein of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to develop broad-spectrum inhibitors of nsp16. Computational methods were used to filter candidates from a natural product-based library of 224,205 compounds obtained from the ZINC database. The binding of the candidates to nsp16 was assessed using virtual screening with VINA LC, and molecular docking with AutoDock 4.2.6. The top 9 compounds were bound to the nsp16 protein of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV with the lowest binding energies (LBEs) in the range of −9.0 to −13.0 kcal with VINA LC. The AutoDock-based LBEs for nsp16 of SARS-CoV-2 ranged from −11.42 to −16.11 kcal/mol with predicted inhibition constants (pKi) from 0.002 to 4.51 nM, the natural substrate S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) was used as control. In silico results were verified by microscale thermophoresis as in vitro assay. The candidates were investigated further for their cytotoxicity in normal MRC-5 lung fibroblasts to determine their therapeutic indices. Here, the IC50 values of all three compounds were {\textbackslash}textgreater10 µM. In summary, we identified three novel SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, two of which showed broad-spectrum activity to nsp16 in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV. All three compounds are coumarin derivatives that contain chromen-2-one in their scaffolds.},

	abstract = {The nucleocapsid protein (NP) is one of the main proteins out of four structural proteins of coronaviruses including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, discovered in 2019. NP packages the viral RNA during virus assembly and is, therefore, indispensable for virus reproduction. NP consists of two domains, i.e., the N- and C-terminal domains. RNA-binding is mainly performed by a binding pocket within the N-terminal domain (NTD). NP represents an important target for drug discovery to treat COVID-19. In this project, we used the Vina LC virtual drug screening software and a ZINC-based database with 210,541 natural and naturally derived compounds that specifically target the binding pocket of NTD of NP. Our aim was to identify coronaviral inhibitors that target NP not only of SARS-CoV-2 but also of other diverse human pathogenic coronaviruses. Virtual drug screening and molecular docking procedures resulted in 73 candidate compounds with a binding affinity below −9 kcal/mol with NP NTD of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HoC-229E, and HCoV-HKU1. The top five compounds that met the applied drug-likeness criteria were then tested for their binding in vitro to the NTD of the full-length recombinant NP proteins using microscale thermophoresis. Compounds (1), (2), and (4), which belong to the same scaffold family of 4-oxo-substituted-6-[2-(4a-hydroxy-decahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)2H-chromen-2-ones and which are derivates of coumarin, were bound with good affinity to NP. Compounds (1) and (4) were bound to the full-length NP of SARS-CoV-2 (aa 1–419) with Kd values of 0.798 (±0.02) µM and 8.07 (±0.36) µM, respectively. Then, these coumarin derivatives were tested with the SARS-CoV-2 NP NTD (aa 48–174). Compounds (1) and (4) revealed Kd-values of 0.95 (±0.32) µM and 7.77 (±6.39) µM, respectively. Compounds (1) and (4) caused low toxicity in human A549 and MRC-5 cell lines. These compounds may represent possible drug candidates, which need further optimization to be used against COVID-19 and other coronaviral infections.},

	abstract = {Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

We found that this type of deliberate practice was prevalent when advanced musicians practice alone and found its accumulated duration related to attained music performance. In contrast, Macnamara, Moreau, and Hambrick’s (2016, this issue) main meta-analysis examines the use of the term deliberate practice to refer to a much broader and less defined concept including virtually any type of sport-specific activity, such as group activities, watching games on television, and even play and competitions. Summing up every hour of any type of practice during an individual’s career implies that the impact of all types of practice activity on performance is equal—an assumption that I show is inconsistent with the evidence. Future research should collect objective measures of representative performance with a longitudinal description of all the changes in different aspects of the performance so that any proximal conditions of deliberate practice related to effective improvements can be identified and analyzed experimentally.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and the concomitant reduction in sequencing costs allows unprecedented high throughput profiling of biological systems in a cost-efficient manner. Modern biological experiments are increasingly becoming both data and computationally intensive and the wealth of publicly available biological data is introducing bioinformatics into the “Big Data” era. For these reasons, the effective application of High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures is becoming progressively more recognized also by bioinformaticians. Here we describe HPC resources provisioning pilot programs dedicated to bioinformaticians, run by the Italian Node of ELIXIR (ELIXIR-IT) in collaboration with CINECA, the main Italian supercomputing center. Results Starting from April 2016, CINECA and ELIXIR-IT launched the pilot Call “ELIXIR-IT HPC@CINECA”, offering streamlined access to HPC resources for bioinformatics. Resources are made available either through web front-ends to dedicated workflows developed at CINECA or by providing direct access to the High Performance Computing systems through a standard command-line interface tailored for bioinformatics data analysis. This allows to offer to the biomedical research community a production scale environment, continuously updated with the latest available versions of publicly available reference datasets and bioinformatic tools. Currently, 63 research projects have gained access to the HPC@CINECA program, for a total handout of {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilde 8 Millions of CPU/hours and, for data storage, {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilde 100 TB of permanent and {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilde 300 TB of temporary space. Conclusions Three years after the beginning of the ELIXIR-IT HPC@CINECA program, we can appreciate its impact over the Italian bioinformatics community and draw some considerations. Several Italian researchers who applied to the program have gained access to one of the top-ranking public scientific supercomputing facilities in Europe. Those investigators had the opportunity to sensibly reduce computational turnaround times in their research projects and to process massive amounts of data, pursuing research approaches that would have been otherwise difficult or impossible to undertake. Moreover, by taking advantage of the wealth of documentation and training material provided by CINECA, participants had the opportunity to improve their skills in the usage of HPC systems and be better positioned to apply to similar EU programs of greater scale, such as PRACE. To illustrate the effective usage and impact of the resources awarded by the program - in different research applications - we report five successful use cases, which have already published their findings in peer-reviewed journals.},

	abstract = {Good self-control has been linked to adaptive outcomes such as better health, cohesive personal relationships, success in the workplace and at school, and less susceptibility to crime and addictions. In contrast, self-control failure is linked to maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting better regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding self-control is the strength or resource depletion model. Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource that becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting in self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which people completing an initial self-control task have reduced self-control capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent task, a state known as ego depletion. Although a meta-analysis of ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence of the effect and identified instances of possible bias. The analyses served as a catalyst for the current Registered Replication Report of the ego-depletion effect. Multiple laboratories ( k = 23, total N = 2,141) conducted replications of a standardized ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task paradigm by Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed that the size of the ego-depletion effect was small with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) that encompassed zero ( d = 0.04, 95\% CI [−0.07, 0.15]. We discuss implications of the findings for the ego-depletion effect and the resource depletion model of self-control.},

Thus this study serves as a test of whether the findings in the earlier studies were specific to certain institutions, student cohorts, and programming languages. Also, we used a non-parametric approach to the analysis, rather than the linear approach of earlier studies. Our results are consistent with the earlier studies. We found that students who cannot trace code usually cannot explain code, and also that students who tend to perform reasonably well at code writing tasks have also usually acquired the ability to both trace code and explain code.},

	abstract = {Background : Knowing the needs of the bioimaging community with respect to research data management (RDM) is essential for identifying measures that enable adoption of the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for microscopy and bioimage analysis data across disciplines. As an initiative within Germany's National Research Data Infrastructure, we conducted this community survey in summer 2021 to assess the state of the art of bioimaging RDM and the community needs. Methods : An online survey was conducted with a mixed question-type design. We created a questionnaire tailored to relevant topics of the bioimaging community, including specific questions on bioimaging methods and bioimage analysis, as well as more general questions on RDM principles and tools. 203 survey entries were included in the analysis covering the perspectives from various life and biomedical science disciplines and from participants at different career levels. Results : The results highlight the importance and value of bioimaging RDM and data sharing. However, the practical implementation of FAIR practices is impeded by technical hurdles, lack of knowledge, and insecurity about the legal aspects of data sharing. The survey participants request metadata guidelines and annotation tools and endorse the usage of image data management platforms. At present, OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects) is the best known and most widely used platform. Most respondents rely on image processing and analysis, which they regard as the most time-consuming step of the bioimage data workflow. While knowledge about and implementation of electronic lab notebooks and data management plans is limited, respondents acknowledge their potential value for data handling and publication. Conclusion : The bioimaging community acknowledges and endorses the value of RDM and data sharing. Still, there is a need for information, guidance, and standardization to foster the adoption of FAIR data handling. This survey may help inspiring targeted measures to close this gap.},

They have a wide range of toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, neuronal toxicity, and carcinogenesis. Yet, biological targets responsible for these effects are not well addressed. Using methods of computational biology for target identification, we tested more than 200 PAs. We used a machine-learning approach that applies structural similarity for target identification, ChemMapper, and SwissTargetPrediction. The predicted targets with high probabilities were muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1. The predicted interactions between these two targets and PAs were further studied by molecular docking-based binding energies using AutoDock and VinaLC, which revealed good binding affinities. The PAs are bound to the same binding pocket as pirenzepine, a known M1 antagonist. These results were confirmed by in vitro assays showing that PAs increased the levels of intracellular calcium. We conclude that PAs are potential acetylcholine receptor M1 antagonists. This elucidates for the first time the serious neuro-oncological toxicities exerted by PA consumption.},

	abstract = {During the past three decades, humans have been confronted with different new coronavirus outbreaks. Since the end of the year 2019, COVID-19 threatens the world as a rapidly spreading infectious disease. For this work, we targeted the non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) as a key protein of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to develop broad-spectrum inhibitors of nsp16. Computational methods were used to filter candidates from a natural product-based library of 224,205 compounds obtained from the ZINC database. The binding of the candidates to nsp16 was assessed using virtual screening with VINA LC, and molecular docking with AutoDock 4.2.6. The top 9 compounds were bound to the nsp16 protein of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV with the lowest binding energies (LBEs) in the range of −9.0 to −13.0 kcal with VINA LC. The AutoDock-based LBEs for nsp16 of SARS-CoV-2 ranged from −11.42 to −16.11 kcal/mol with predicted inhibition constants (pKi) from 0.002 to 4.51 nM, the natural substrate S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) was used as control. In silico results were verified by microscale thermophoresis as in vitro assay. The candidates were investigated further for their cytotoxicity in normal MRC-5 lung fibroblasts to determine their therapeutic indices. Here, the IC50 values of all three compounds were {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextgreater10 µM. In summary, we identified three novel SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, two of which showed broad-spectrum activity to nsp16 in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV. All three compounds are coumarin derivatives that contain chromen-2-one in their scaffolds.},

	abstract = {The nucleocapsid protein (NP) is one of the main proteins out of four structural proteins of coronaviruses including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, discovered in 2019. NP packages the viral RNA during virus assembly and is, therefore, indispensable for virus reproduction. NP consists of two domains, i.e., the N- and C-terminal domains. RNA-binding is mainly performed by a binding pocket within the N-terminal domain (NTD). NP represents an important target for drug discovery to treat COVID-19. In this project, we used the Vina LC virtual drug screening software and a ZINC-based database with 210,541 natural and naturally derived compounds that specifically target the binding pocket of NTD of NP. Our aim was to identify coronaviral inhibitors that target NP not only of SARS-CoV-2 but also of other diverse human pathogenic coronaviruses. Virtual drug screening and molecular docking procedures resulted in 73 candidate compounds with a binding affinity below −9 kcal/mol with NP NTD of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HoC-229E, and HCoV-HKU1. The top five compounds that met the applied drug-likeness criteria were then tested for their binding in vitro to the NTD of the full-length recombinant NP proteins using microscale thermophoresis. Compounds (1), (2), and (4), which belong to the same scaffold family of 4-oxo-substituted-6-[2-(4a-hydroxy-decahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)2H-chromen-2-ones and which are derivates of coumarin, were bound with good affinity to NP. Compounds (1) and (4) were bound to the full-length NP of SARS-CoV-2 (aa 1–419) with Kd values of 0.798 (±0.02) µM and 8.07 (±0.36) µM, respectively. Then, these coumarin derivatives were tested with the SARS-CoV-2 NP NTD (aa 48–174). Compounds (1) and (4) revealed Kd-values of 0.95 (±0.32) µM and 7.77 (±6.39) µM, respectively. Compounds (1) and (4) caused low toxicity in human A549 and MRC-5 cell lines. These compounds may represent possible drug candidates, which need further optimization to be used against COVID-19 and other coronaviral infections.},

	abstract = {Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

All of the estimated effects were positive and all were statistically significant except results from metaregressions involving affective outcomes. Characteristics of the publications, methodology, and sample were not systematically related to effect estimates. Effects showed little decline during maintenance, and effects for academic subjects were greater when students had more exposure to the programs. Estimated effects were educationally significant, moderate to large when using the traditional psychological benchmarks, and similar in magnitude to effect sizes that reflect performance gaps between more and less advantaged students.},

Careful design of the items in the puzzles allows the tutor to highlight particular topics and common programming errors. Since each puzzle solution is a complete sample of well-written code, use of the tool exposes students to good programming practice. This paper discusses the motivation of Parson's Programming Puzzles, and gives several examples.

We found that this type of deliberate practice was prevalent when advanced musicians practice alone and found its accumulated duration related to attained music performance. In contrast, Macnamara, Moreau, and Hambrick’s (2016, this issue) main meta-analysis examines the use of the term deliberate practice to refer to a much broader and less defined concept including virtually any type of sport-specific activity, such as group activities, watching games on television, and even play and competitions. Summing up every hour of any type of practice during an individual’s career implies that the impact of all types of practice activity on performance is equal—an assumption that I show is inconsistent with the evidence. Future research should collect objective measures of representative performance with a longitudinal description of all the changes in different aspects of the performance so that any proximal conditions of deliberate practice related to effective improvements can be identified and analyzed experimentally.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and the concomitant reduction in sequencing costs allows unprecedented high throughput profiling of biological systems in a cost-efficient manner. Modern biological experiments are increasingly becoming both data and computationally intensive and the wealth of publicly available biological data is introducing bioinformatics into the “Big Data” era. For these reasons, the effective application of High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures is becoming progressively more recognized also by bioinformaticians. Here we describe HPC resources provisioning pilot programs dedicated to bioinformaticians, run by the Italian Node of ELIXIR (ELIXIR-IT) in collaboration with CINECA, the main Italian supercomputing center. Results Starting from April 2016, CINECA and ELIXIR-IT launched the pilot Call “ELIXIR-IT HPC@CINECA”, offering streamlined access to HPC resources for bioinformatics. Resources are made available either through web front-ends to dedicated workflows developed at CINECA or by providing direct access to the High Performance Computing systems through a standard command-line interface tailored for bioinformatics data analysis. This allows to offer to the biomedical research community a production scale environment, continuously updated with the latest available versions of publicly available reference datasets and bioinformatic tools. Currently, 63 research projects have gained access to the HPC@CINECA program, for a total handout of {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilde 8 Millions of CPU/hours and, for data storage, {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilde 100 TB of permanent and {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilde 300 TB of temporary space. Conclusions Three years after the beginning of the ELIXIR-IT HPC@CINECA program, we can appreciate its impact over the Italian bioinformatics community and draw some considerations. Several Italian researchers who applied to the program have gained access to one of the top-ranking public scientific supercomputing facilities in Europe. Those investigators had the opportunity to sensibly reduce computational turnaround times in their research projects and to process massive amounts of data, pursuing research approaches that would have been otherwise difficult or impossible to undertake. Moreover, by taking advantage of the wealth of documentation and training material provided by CINECA, participants had the opportunity to improve their skills in the usage of HPC systems and be better positioned to apply to similar EU programs of greater scale, such as PRACE. To illustrate the effective usage and impact of the resources awarded by the program - in different research applications - we report five successful use cases, which have already published their findings in peer-reviewed journals.},

	abstract = {Good self-control has been linked to adaptive outcomes such as better health, cohesive personal relationships, success in the workplace and at school, and less susceptibility to crime and addictions. In contrast, self-control failure is linked to maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting better regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding self-control is the strength or resource depletion model. Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource that becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting in self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which people completing an initial self-control task have reduced self-control capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent task, a state known as ego depletion. Although a meta-analysis of ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence of the effect and identified instances of possible bias. The analyses served as a catalyst for the current Registered Replication Report of the ego-depletion effect. Multiple laboratories ( k = 23, total N = 2,141) conducted replications of a standardized ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task paradigm by Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed that the size of the ego-depletion effect was small with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) that encompassed zero ( d = 0.04, 95\% CI [−0.07, 0.15]. We discuss implications of the findings for the ego-depletion effect and the resource depletion model of self-control.},

Thus this study serves as a test of whether the findings in the earlier studies were specific to certain institutions, student cohorts, and programming languages. Also, we used a non-parametric approach to the analysis, rather than the linear approach of earlier studies. Our results are consistent with the earlier studies. We found that students who cannot trace code usually cannot explain code, and also that students who tend to perform reasonably well at code writing tasks have also usually acquired the ability to both trace code and explain code.},

	abstract = {Background : Knowing the needs of the bioimaging community with respect to research data management (RDM) is essential for identifying measures that enable adoption of the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for microscopy and bioimage analysis data across disciplines. As an initiative within Germany's National Research Data Infrastructure, we conducted this community survey in summer 2021 to assess the state of the art of bioimaging RDM and the community needs. Methods : An online survey was conducted with a mixed question-type design. We created a questionnaire tailored to relevant topics of the bioimaging community, including specific questions on bioimaging methods and bioimage analysis, as well as more general questions on RDM principles and tools. 203 survey entries were included in the analysis covering the perspectives from various life and biomedical science disciplines and from participants at different career levels. Results : The results highlight the importance and value of bioimaging RDM and data sharing. However, the practical implementation of FAIR practices is impeded by technical hurdles, lack of knowledge, and insecurity about the legal aspects of data sharing. The survey participants request metadata guidelines and annotation tools and endorse the usage of image data management platforms. At present, OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects) is the best known and most widely used platform. Most respondents rely on image processing and analysis, which they regard as the most time-consuming step of the bioimage data workflow. While knowledge about and implementation of electronic lab notebooks and data management plans is limited, respondents acknowledge their potential value for data handling and publication. Conclusion : The bioimaging community acknowledges and endorses the value of RDM and data sharing. Still, there is a need for information, guidance, and standardization to foster the adoption of FAIR data handling. This survey may help inspiring targeted measures to close this gap.},

They have a wide range of toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, neuronal toxicity, and carcinogenesis. Yet, biological targets responsible for these effects are not well addressed. Using methods of computational biology for target identification, we tested more than 200 PAs. We used a machine-learning approach that applies structural similarity for target identification, ChemMapper, and SwissTargetPrediction. The predicted targets with high probabilities were muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1. The predicted interactions between these two targets and PAs were further studied by molecular docking-based binding energies using AutoDock and VinaLC, which revealed good binding affinities. The PAs are bound to the same binding pocket as pirenzepine, a known M1 antagonist. These results were confirmed by in vitro assays showing that PAs increased the levels of intracellular calcium. We conclude that PAs are potential acetylcholine receptor M1 antagonists. This elucidates for the first time the serious neuro-oncological toxicities exerted by PA consumption.},

	abstract = {During the past three decades, humans have been confronted with different new coronavirus outbreaks. Since the end of the year 2019, COVID-19 threatens the world as a rapidly spreading infectious disease. For this work, we targeted the non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) as a key protein of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to develop broad-spectrum inhibitors of nsp16. Computational methods were used to filter candidates from a natural product-based library of 224,205 compounds obtained from the ZINC database. The binding of the candidates to nsp16 was assessed using virtual screening with VINA LC, and molecular docking with AutoDock 4.2.6. The top 9 compounds were bound to the nsp16 protein of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV with the lowest binding energies (LBEs) in the range of −9.0 to −13.0 kcal with VINA LC. The AutoDock-based LBEs for nsp16 of SARS-CoV-2 ranged from −11.42 to −16.11 kcal/mol with predicted inhibition constants (pKi) from 0.002 to 4.51 nM, the natural substrate S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) was used as control. In silico results were verified by microscale thermophoresis as in vitro assay. The candidates were investigated further for their cytotoxicity in normal MRC-5 lung fibroblasts to determine their therapeutic indices. Here, the IC50 values of all three compounds were {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextgreater10 µM. In summary, we identified three novel SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, two of which showed broad-spectrum activity to nsp16 in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV. All three compounds are coumarin derivatives that contain chromen-2-one in their scaffolds.},

	abstract = {The nucleocapsid protein (NP) is one of the main proteins out of four structural proteins of coronaviruses including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, discovered in 2019. NP packages the viral RNA during virus assembly and is, therefore, indispensable for virus reproduction. NP consists of two domains, i.e., the N- and C-terminal domains. RNA-binding is mainly performed by a binding pocket within the N-terminal domain (NTD). NP represents an important target for drug discovery to treat COVID-19. In this project, we used the Vina LC virtual drug screening software and a ZINC-based database with 210,541 natural and naturally derived compounds that specifically target the binding pocket of NTD of NP. Our aim was to identify coronaviral inhibitors that target NP not only of SARS-CoV-2 but also of other diverse human pathogenic coronaviruses. Virtual drug screening and molecular docking procedures resulted in 73 candidate compounds with a binding affinity below −9 kcal/mol with NP NTD of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HoC-229E, and HCoV-HKU1. The top five compounds that met the applied drug-likeness criteria were then tested for their binding in vitro to the NTD of the full-length recombinant NP proteins using microscale thermophoresis. Compounds (1), (2), and (4), which belong to the same scaffold family of 4-oxo-substituted-6-[2-(4a-hydroxy-decahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)2H-chromen-2-ones and which are derivates of coumarin, were bound with good affinity to NP. Compounds (1) and (4) were bound to the full-length NP of SARS-CoV-2 (aa 1–419) with Kd values of 0.798 (±0.02) µM and 8.07 (±0.36) µM, respectively. Then, these coumarin derivatives were tested with the SARS-CoV-2 NP NTD (aa 48–174). Compounds (1) and (4) revealed Kd-values of 0.95 (±0.32) µM and 7.77 (±6.39) µM, respectively. Compounds (1) and (4) caused low toxicity in human A549 and MRC-5 cell lines. These compounds may represent possible drug candidates, which need further optimization to be used against COVID-19 and other coronaviral infections.},

	abstract = {Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

Results are reported for the total set and subareas regarding reading, math, language, spelling, and multiple or other academic subjects; ability measures; affective outcomes; teacher and parent views; and single-subject designs. All of the estimated effects were positive and all were statistically significant except results from metaregressions involving affective outcomes. Characteristics of the publications, methodology, and sample were not systematically related to effect estimates. Effects showed little decline during maintenance, and effects for academic subjects were greater when students had more exposure to the programs. Estimated effects were educationally significant, moderate to large when using the traditional psychological benchmarks, and similar in magnitude to effect sizes that reflect performance gaps between more and less advantaged students.},

In contrast, Macnamara, Moreau, and Hambrick’s (2016, this issue) main meta-analysis examines the use of the term deliberate practice to refer to a much broader and less defined concept including virtually any type of sport-specific activity, such as group activities, watching games on television, and even play and competitions. Summing up every hour of any type of practice during an individual’s career implies that the impact of all types of practice activity on performance is equal—an assumption that I show is inconsistent with the evidence. Future research should collect objective measures of representative performance with a longitudinal description of all the changes in different aspects of the performance so that any proximal conditions of deliberate practice related to effective improvements can be identified and analyzed experimentally.},

              Motivation
              In RNA-seq differential expression analysis, investigators aim to detect those genes with changes in expression level across conditions, despite technical and biological variability in the observations. A common task is to accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a logarithmic fold change (LFC).
            
            
              Results
              When the read counts are low or highly variable, the maximum likelihood estimates for the LFCs has high variance, leading to large estimates not representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by effect size. One approach is to introduce filtering thresholds and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated LFCs. Filtering may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with true differences in expression, while pseudocounts provide a limited solution that must be adapted per dataset. Here, we propose the use of a heavy-tailed Cauchy prior distribution for effect sizes, which avoids the use of filter thresholds or pseudocounts. The proposed method, Approximate Posterior Estimation for generalized linear model, apeglm, has lower bias than previously proposed shrinkage estimators, while still reducing variance for those genes with little information for statistical inference.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              The apeglm package is available as an R/Bioconductor package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/apeglm, and the methods can be called from within the DESeq2 software.

              In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present
              DESeq2

              While splicing changes caused by somatic mutations in
              SF3B1
              are known, identifying full-length isoform changes may better elucidate the functional consequences of these mutations. We report nanopore sequencing of full-length cDNA from CLL samples with and without
              SF3B1
              mutation, as well as normal B cell samples, giving a total of 149 million pass reads. We present FLAIR (Full-Length Alternative Isoform analysis of RNA), a computational workflow to identify high-confidence transcripts, perform differential splicing event analysis, and differential isoform analysis. Using nanopore reads, we demonstrate differential 3’ splice site changes associated with
              SF3B1
              mutation, agreeing with previous studies. We also observe a strong downregulation of intron retention events associated with
              SF3B1
              mutation. Full-length transcript analysis links multiple alternative splicing events together and allows for better estimates of the abundance of productive versus unproductive isoforms. Our work demonstrates the potential utility of nanopore sequencing for cancer and splicing research.},

              Motivation
              Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms.
            
            
              Results
              Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of ≥100 bp in length, ≥1 kb genomic reads at error rate ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3–4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.

            To explore complex biological questions, it is often necessary to access various data types from public data repositories. As the volume and complexity of biological sequence data grow, public repositories face significant challenges in ensuring that the data is easily discoverable and usable by the biological research community. To address these challenges, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has created NCBI Datasets. This resource provides straightforward, comprehensive, and scalable access to biological sequences, annotations, and metadata for a wide range of taxa. Following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data management principles, NCBI Datasets offers user-friendly web interfaces, command-line tools, and documented APIs, empowering researchers to access NCBI data seamlessly. The data is delivered as packages of sequences and metadata, thus facilitating improved data retrieval, sharing, and usability in research. Moreover, this data delivery method fosters effective data attribution and promotes its further reuse. This paper outlines the current scope of data accessible through NCBI Datasets and explains various options for exploring and downloading the data.},

While many papers have studied read correction methods, few have addressed the detailed characterization of observed errors, a task complicated by frequent changes in chemistry and software in ONT technology. The MinION sequencer is now more stable and this paper proposes an up-to-date view of its error landscape, using the most mature flowcell and basecaller. We studied Nanopore sequencing error biases on both bacterial and human DNA reads. We found that, although Nanopore sequencing is expected not to suffer from GC bias, it is a crucial parameter with respect to errors. In particular, low-GC reads have fewer errors than high-GC reads (about 6\% and 8\% respectively). The error profile for homopolymeric regions or regions with short repeats, the source of about half of all sequencing errors, also depends on the GC rate and mainly shows deletions, although there are some reads with long insertions. Another interesting finding is that the quality measure, although over-estimated, offers valuable information to predict the error rate as well as the abundance of reads. We supplemented this study with an analysis of a rapeseed RNA read set and shown a higher level of errors with a higher level of deletion in these data. Finally, we have implemented an open source pipeline for long-term monitoring of the error profile, which enables users to easily compute various analysis presented in this work, including for future developments of the sequencing device. Overall, we hope this work will provide a basis for the design of better error-correction methods.},

              Background
              Long-read sequencing can be applied to generate very long contigs and even completely assembled genomes at relatively low cost and with minimal sample preparation. As a result, long-read sequencing platforms are becoming more popular. In this respect, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies–based long-read sequencing “nanopore" platform is becoming a widely used tool with a broad range of applications and end-users. However, the need to explore and manipulate the complex data generated by long-read sequencing platforms necessitates accompanying specialized bioinformatics platforms and tools to process the long-read data correctly. Importantly, such tools should additionally help democratize bioinformatics analysis by enabling easy access and ease-of-use solutions for researchers.
            
            
              Results
              The Galaxy platform provides a user-friendly interface to computational command line–based tools, handles the software dependencies, and provides refined workflows. The users do not have to possess programming experience or extended computer skills. The interface enables researchers to perform powerful bioinformatics analysis, including the assembly and analysis of short- or long-read sequence data. The newly developed “NanoGalaxy" is a Galaxy-based toolkit for analysing long-read sequencing data, which is suitable for diverse applications, including de novo genome assembly from genomic, metagenomic, and plasmid sequence reads.
            
            
              Conclusions
              A range of best-practice tools and workflows for long-read sequence genome assembly has been integrated into a NanoGalaxy platform to facilitate easy access and use of bioinformatics tools for researchers.

            Application of Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ long-read sequencing platform to transcriptomic analysis is increasing in popularity. However, such analysis can be challenging due to the high sequence error and small library sizes, which decreases quantification accuracy and reduces power for statistical testing. Here, we report the analysis of two nanopore RNA-seq datasets with the goal of obtaining gene- and isoform-level differential expression information. A dataset of synthetic, spliced, spike-in RNAs (‘sequins’) as well as a mouse neural stem cell dataset from samples with a null mutation of the epigenetic regulator Smchd1 was analysed using a mix of long-read specific tools for preprocessing together with established short-read RNA-seq methods for downstream analysis. We used limma-voom to perform differential gene expression analysis, and the novel FLAMES pipeline to perform isoform identification and quantification, followed by DRIMSeq and limma-diffSplice (with stageR) to perform differential transcript usage analysis. We compared results from the sequins dataset to the ground truth, and results of the mouse dataset to a previous short-read study on equivalent samples. Overall, our work shows that transcriptomic analysis of long-read nanopore data using long-read specific preprocessing methods together with short-read differential expression methods and software that are already in wide use can yield meaningful results.},

              Background
              Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.
            
            
              Results
              We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

            Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technologies produce unprecedented amounts of data, leading to completely new research fields. One of these is metagenomics, the study of large-size DNA samples containing a multitude of diverse organisms. A key problem in metagenomics is to functionally and taxonomically classify the sequenced DNA, to which end the well-known BLAST program is usually used. But BLAST has dramatic resource requirements at metagenomic scales of data, imposing a high financial or technical burden on the researcher. Multiple attempts have been made to overcome these limitations and present a viable alternative to BLAST.
            Results: In this work we present Lambda, our own alternative for BLAST in the context of sequence classification. In our tests, Lambda often outperforms the best tools at reproducing BLAST’s results and is the fastest compared with the current state of the art at comparable levels of sensitivity.
            Availability and implementation: Lambda was implemented in the SeqAn open-source C++ library for sequence analysis and is publicly available for download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/lambda.

It is 3–4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.https://github.com/lh3/minimap2Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In this study, we systematically evaluated 10 DS analysis tools for consistency and reproducibility, precision, recall and false discovery rate, agreement upon reported differentially spliced genes and functional enrichment. The tools were selected to represent the three different methodological categories: exon-based (DEXSeq, edgeR, JunctionSeq, limma), isoform-based (cuffdiff2, DiffSplice) and event-based methods (dSpliceType, MAJIQ, rMATS, SUPPA). Overall, all the exon-based methods and two event-based methods (MAJIQ and rMATS) scored well on the selected measures. Of the 10 tools tested, the exon-based methods performed generally better than the isoform-based and event-based methods. However, overall, the different data analysis tools performed strikingly differently across different data sets or numbers of samples.},

In this Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers, compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows, and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users.

However, different isoforms can be highly similar, and with an average length of 1.5kb remain difficult to study with short read sequencing. To systematically evaluate the ability to study the transcriptome at a resolution of individual isoforms we profiled 5 human cell lines with short read cDNA sequencing and Nanopore long read direct RNA, amplification-free direct cDNA, PCR-cDNA sequencing. The long read protocols showed a high level of consistency, with amplification-free RNA and cDNA sequencing being most similar. While short and long reads generated comparable gene expression estimates, they differed substantially for individual isoforms. We find that increased read length improves read-to-transcript assignment, identifies interactions between alternative promoters and splicing, enables the discovery of novel transcripts from repetitive regions, facilitates the quantification of full-length fusion isoforms and enables the simultaneous profiling of m6A RNA modifications when RNA is sequenced directly. Our study demonstrates the advantage of long read RNA sequencing and provides a comprehensive resource that will enable the development and benchmarking of computational methods for profiling complex transcriptional events at isoform-level resolution.},

Developers utilized these data to address challenges in transcript isoform detection, quantification and de novo transcript detection. The study revealed that libraries with longer, more accurate sequences produce more accurate transcripts than those with increased read depth, whereas greater read depth improved quantification accuracy. In well-annotated genomes, tools based on reference sequences demonstrated the best performance. Incorporating additional orthogonal data and replicate samples is advised when aiming to detect rare and novel transcripts or using reference-free approaches.

Results: While limitations exist, this study demonstrates a successful implementation of a pipeline with several discrete software applications for the analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.

Here, we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible, but practical in both time and effort. This suite combines three well-tested components—a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and workflow systems that automatically orchestrate the composition of these packages for entire pipelines—to achieve an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility. We also provide a practical implementation and five recommendations to help set a typical researcher on the path to performing data analyses reproducibly.},

This profile differs significantly from the standard benchmark since the 28S rRNA of most insects contains an endogenous “hidden break.” Upon denaturation, the masking hydrogen bonds are disrupted, releasing two similar sized fragments that both migrate closely with 18S rRNA. The resulting rRNA profile thus reflects the endogenous composition of insect rRNA and should not be misinterpreted as degradation.},

This band could only be found in the thummi chromosome partner, it is heterochromatic and contains AT-rich DNA. In female hybrid larvae, however, such a selectively stained band is present in neither the thummi nor the piger chromosome region D3d-g.

Chromosome III 'displays a hemizygous cluster of Cla elements in males but not in females. The chromosomal location Of this hemizygous Cla element cluster is in the region of the male determiner M as localized by cytogenetic analysis. With Cla elements as hybridization probe, it was possible to clone a large part of the sex determining region. Molecular analysis of the DNA of males and females in this region displayed a number of differences between the two sexes. One striking difference is an unusual transposable element associated with the male sex determining region. The sex determining region also contains several other tandem-repetitive DNA elements in addition to the Cla elements. They are interspersed with single copy DNA. The accumulation of repetitive elements in the sex determining region is interpreted as the result of a lack of recombination between the male/female hetcromorphic region, although recombination in the other sections of chromosome II1 occurs.},

Assessment of sequencing performance and library quality is critical to the interpretation of RNA-seq data, yet few tools exist to address this issue. We introduce RNA-SeQC, a program which provides key measures of data quality. These metrics include yield, alignment and duplication rates; GC bias, rRNA content, regions of alignment (exon, intron and intragenic), continuity of coverage, 3′/5′ bias and count of detectable transcripts, among others. The software provides multi-sample evaluation of library construction protocols, input materials and other experimental parameters. The modularity of the software enables pipeline integration and the routine monitoring of key measures of data quality such as the number of alignable reads, duplication rates and rRNA contamination. RNA-SeQC allows investigators to make informed decisions about sample inclusion in downstream analysis. In summary, RNA-SeQC provides quality control measures critical to experiment design, process optimization and downstream computational analysis.Availability and implementation: See www.genepattern.org to run online, or www.broadinstitute.org/rna-seqc/ for a command line tool.Contact:  ddeluca@broadinstitute.orgSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Background: Long-read sequencing is rapidly evolving and reshaping the suite of opportunities for genomic analysis. For the MinION in particular, as both the platform and chemistry develop, the user community requires reference data to set performance expectations and maximally exploit third-generation sequencing. We performed an analysis of MinION data derived from whole genome sequencing of Escherichia coli K-12 using the R9.0 chemistry, comparing the results with the older R7.3 chemistry. Methods: We computed the error-rate estimates for insertions, deletions, and mismatches in MinION reads. Results: Run-time characteristics of the flow cell and run scripts for R9.0 were similar to those observed for R7.3 chemistry, but with an 8-fold increase in bases per second (from 30 bps in R7.3 and SQK-MAP005 library preparation, to 250 bps in R9.0) processed by individual nanopores, and less drop-off in yield over time. The 2-dimensional (“2D”) N50 read length was unchanged from the prior chemistry. Using the proportion of alignable reads as a measure of base-call accuracy, 99.9\% of “pass” template reads from 1-dimensional (“1D”) \&nbsp;experiments were mappable and {\textasciitilde}97\% from 2D experiments. The median identity of reads was {\textasciitilde}89\% for 1D and {\textasciitilde}94\% for 2D experiments. The total error rate (miscall + insertion + deletion ) decreased for 2D “pass” reads from 9.1\% in R7.3 to 7.5\% in R9.0 and for template “pass” reads from 26.7\% in R7.3 to 14.5\% in R9.0. Conclusions: These Phase 2 MinION experiments serve as a baseline by providing estimates for read quality, throughput, and mappability. The datasets further enable the development of bioinformatic tools tailored to the new R9.0 chemistry and the design of novel biological applications for this technology.

Recently, numerous computational tools for isoform detection using long-read sequencing data have been developed. Nevertheless, there remains a deficiency in comparative studies that systemically evaluate the performance of these tools, which are implemented with different algorithms, under various simulations that encompass potential influencing factors. In this study, we conducted a benchmark analysis of thirteen methods implemented in nine tools capable of identifying isoform structures from long-read RNA-seq data. We evaluated their performances using simulated data, which represented diverse sequencing platforms generated by an in-house simulator, RNA sequins (sequencing spike-ins) data, as well as experimental data. Our findings demonstrate IsoQuant as a highly effective tool for isoform detection with LRS, with Bambu and StringTie2 also exhibiting strong performance. These results offer valuable guidance for future research on alternative splicing analysis and the ongoing improvement of tools for isoform detection using LRS data.},

We present FLAIR (Full-Length Alternative Isoform analysis of RNA), a computational workflow to identify high-confidence transcripts, perform differential splicing event analysis, and differential isoform analysis. Using nanopore reads, we demonstrate differential 3’ splice site changes associated with SF3B1 mutation, agreeing with previous studies. We also observe a strong downregulation of intron retention events associated with SF3B1 mutation. Full-length transcript analysis links multiple alternative splicing events together and allows for better estimates of the abundance of productive versus unproductive isoforms.

	abstract = {Innovative scientific applications and emerging dense data sources are creating a data deluge for high-end supercomputing systems. Modern applications are often collaborative in nature, with a distributed user base for input and output data sets. Processing such large input data typically involves copying (or staging) the data onto the supercomputer's specialized high-speed storage, scratch space, for sustained high I/O throughput. This copying is crucial as remotely accessing the data while an application executes results in unnecessary delays and consequently performance degradation. However, the current practice of conservatively staging data as early as possible makes the data vulnerable to storage failures, which may entail restaging and reduced job throughput. To address this, we present a timely staging framework that uses a combination of job start-up time predictions, user-specified volunteer or cloud-based intermediate storage nodes, and decentralized data delivery to coincide input data staging with job start-up. Evaluation of our approach using both PlanetLab and Azure cloud services, as well as simulations based on three years of Jaguar supercomputer (No. 3 in Top500) job logs show as much as 91.0 percent reduction in staging times compared to direct transfers, 75.2 percent reduction in wait time on scratch, and 2.4 percent reduction in usage/hour.

Major change in workflow configuration (/ configurability):



feat!: generalize away condition (PR \#66):
 The workflow can now fully use DESeq2's flexibility in its model setup and does not make use of a particular name for the variable\_of\_interest any more. Instead, there is a new, fully explained, and reasonably intuitive configuration setup in the config.yaml for this, including linkouts to the relevant docs and an explanation in the snakemake workflow catalog docs (that have been improved for unchanged features, as well). Also, this setup and the workflow in general is now more comprehensively tested.


Also lots of smaller fixes:



fix: stable column ordering in count-matrix.py (PR \#60)

updated all wrappers to a current version (PR \#59) (also updates GitHub Actions submodule checkout)

fixed inconsistent file naming to all underscores (\{sample\}\_\{unit\} vs. \{\vphantom{\}}sample)-\{unit\} that we had in some places, PR \#61)

fix: make get\_deseq2\_threads() proper function call in diffexp.smk (PR \#62)

fix: make specification of SRA samples in samples.tsv work, fixes in common.smk (PR \#63)

fix: cutadapt wrapper params from others: to extra: (originally suggested by @kilpert: https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/rna-seq-star-deseq2/commit/f816550598c29ed2840e21b31a592ce87a7ebcfa)

feat: add basic wildcard\_constraints for safer sample and unit names (originally suggested by @kilpert: https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/rna-seq-star-deseq2/commit/5431e08f31890869d606e720993b17bbd44391de)

fix: fix rule align (star) parameters and make gtf an actual input (https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/rna-seq-star-deseq2/commit/fdce8475853745fa41429af5fe7da0726efdbc50)

some smaller cleanup of outdated comments

addressing of some R lints

	abstract = {During the last (15) years, improved omics sequencing technologies have expanded the scale and resolution of various biological applications, generating high-throughput datasets that require carefully chosen software tools to be processed. Therefore, following the sequencing development, bioinformatics researchers have been challenged to implement alignment algorithms for next-generation sequencing reads. However, nowadays selection of aligners based on genome characteristics is poorly studied, so our benchmarking study extended the “state of art” comparing 17 different aligners. The chosen tools were assessed on empirical human DNA- and RNA-Seq data, as well as on simulated datasets in human and mouse, evaluating a set of parameters previously not considered in such kind of benchmarks. As expected, we found that each tool was the best in specific conditions. For Ion Torrent single-end RNA-Seq samples, the most suitable aligners were CLC and BWA-MEM, which reached the best results in terms of efficiency, accuracy, duplication rate, saturation profile and running time. About Illumina paired-end osteomyelitis transcriptomics data, instead, the best performer algorithm, together with the already cited CLC, resulted Novoalign, which excelled in accuracy and saturation analyses. Segemehl and DNASTAR performed the best on both DNA-Seq data, with Segemehl particularly suitable for exome data. In conclusion, our study could guide users in the selection of a suitable aligner based on genome and transcriptome characteristics. However, several other aspects, emerged from our work, should be considered in the evolution of alignment research area, such as the involvement of artificial intelligence to support cloud computing and mapping to multiple genomes.},

Here, we analyzed the characteristics of cathepsin L (CsCatL) in the females of C. septempunctata and its role during the diapause of the ladybeetle. CsCatL was cloned and identified from beetle specimens by rapid amplification of cDNA-ends (RACE). The cDNA sequence of CsCatL was 971 bp in length, including an 843 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 280 amino acids. It was identified as the cathepsin L group by phylogenetic analysis. Knockdown of CsCatL by RNA interference led to decreased expression levels of fatty acid synthase 2 (fas 2) genes and suppressed lipid accumulation. Furthermore, silencing the CsCatL gene distinctly reduced diapause-related features and the survival of female C. spetempunctata under diapause-inducing conditions. The results suggested that the CsCatL gene was involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and played a crucial role in the survival of adult C. septempunctata during the diapause preparation stage.},

Although short-read RNA-sequencing has increased our understanding of isoform diversity, it is challenging to accurately detect full-length transcripts, preventing the identification of many alternate isoforms. Long-read sequencing technologies have made it possible to sequence full-length alternative transcripts, accurately characterizing alternative splicing events, alternate transcription start and end sites, and differences in UTR regions. Here, we use Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read RNA-sequencing (Iso-Seq) to examine the transcriptomes of five organs in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a widely used genetic model species. The threespine stickleback fish has a refined genome assembly in which gene annotations are based on short-read RNA sequencing and predictions from coding sequence of other species. This suggests some of the existing annotations may be inaccurate or alternative transcripts may not be fully characterized. Using Iso-Seq we detected thousands of novel isoforms, indicating many isoforms are absent in the current Ensembl gene annotations. In addition, we refined many of the existing annotations within the genome. We noted many improperly positioned transcription start sites that were refined with long-read sequencing. The Iso-Seq-predicted transcription start sites were more accurate and verified through ATAC-seq. We also detected many alternative splicing events between sexes and across organs. We found a substantial number of genes in both somatic and gonadal samples that had sex-specific isoforms. Our study highlights the power of long-read sequencing to study the complexity of transcriptomes, greatly improving genomic resources for the threespine stickleback fish.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Vitellogenesis is pre-requisite to insect egg production and embryonic development after oviposition. During insect vitellogenesis, the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin (Vg) is mainly synthesized in the fat body, transported by the hemolymph through the intercellular spaces (known as patency) in the follicular epithelium to reach the membrane of maturing oocytes, and sequestered into the maturing oocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Insect vitellogenesis is governed by two critical hormones, the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH) and the ecdysteriod 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). JH acts as the principal gonadotropic hormone to stimulate vitellogenesis in basal hemimetabolous and most holometabolous insects. 20E is critical for vitellogenesis in some hymenopterans, lepidopterans and dipterans. Furthermore, microRNA (miRNA) and nutritional (amino acid/Target of Rapamycin and insulin) pathways interplay with JH and 20E signaling cascades to control insect vitellogenesis. Revealing the regulatory mechanisms underlying insect vitellogenesis is critical for understanding insect reproduction and helpful for developing new strategies of insect pest control. Here, we outline the recent research progress in the molecular action of gonadotropic JH and 20E along with the role of miRNA and nutritional sensor in regulating insect vitellogenesis. We highlight the advancements in the regulatory mechanisms of insect vitellogenesis by the coordination of hormone, miRNA and nutritional signaling pathways.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although much focus has been placed on defining mRNA exon composition and structure with LRS data, less careful characterization has been done of the ability to assess the terminal ends of isoforms, specifically, transcription start and end sites. Such characterization is crucial for completely delineating full mRNA molecules and regulatory consequences. However, there are substantial inconsistencies in both start and end coordinates of LRS reads spanning a gene, such that LRS reads often fail to accurately recapitulate annotated or empirically derived terminal ends of mRNA molecules. Here, we describe the specific challenges of identifying and quantifying mRNA terminal ends with LRS technologies and how these issues influence biological interpretations of LRS data. We then review recent experimental and computational advances designed to alleviate these problems, with ideal use cases for each approach. Finally, we outline anticipated developments and necessary improvements for the characterization of terminal ends from LRS data.},

Distinct isoforms can play important biological roles, including by changing the sequences or expression levels of protein products. The first single-cell approaches to RNA sequencing—and later, spatial approaches—which are now widely used for the identification of differentially expressed genes, rely on short reads and offer the ability to transcriptomically compare different cell types but are limited in their ability to measure differential isoform expression. More recently, long-read sequencing methods have been combined with single-cell and spatial technologies in order to characterize isoform expression. In this review, we provide an overview of the emergence of single-cell and spatial long-read sequencing and discuss the challenges associated with the implementation of these technologies and interpretation of these data. We discuss the opportunities they offer for understanding the relationships between the distinct variable elements of transcript molecules and highlight some of the ways in which they have been used to characterize isoforms’ roles in development and pathology. Single-nucleus long-read sequencing, a special case of the single-cell approach, is also discussed.

            The extensive generation of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data in the last decade has resulted in a myriad of specialized software for its analysis. Each software module typically targets a specific step within the analysis pipeline, making it necessary to join several of them to get a single cohesive workflow. Multiple software programs automating this procedure have been proposed, but often lack modularity, transparency or flexibility. We present ARMOR, which performs an end-to-end RNA-seq data analysis, from raw read files, via quality checks, alignment and quantification, to differential expression testing, geneset analysis and browser-based exploration of the data. ARMOR is implemented using the Snakemake workflow management system and leverages conda environments; Bioconductor objects are generated to facilitate downstream analysis, ensuring seamless integration with many R packages. The workflow is easily implemented by cloning the GitHub repository, replacing the supplied input and reference files and editing a configuration file. Although we have selected the tools currently included in ARMOR, the setup is modular and alternative tools can be easily integrated.},

	abstract = {Gene fusions are found as cancer drivers in diverse adult and pediatric cancers. Accurate detection of fusion transcripts is essential in cancer clinical diagnostics and prognostics and for guiding therapeutic development. Most currently available methods for fusion transcript detection are compatible with Illumina RNA-seq involving highly accurate short-read sequences. Recent advances in long-read isoform sequencing enable the detection of fusion transcripts at unprecedented resolution in bulk and single-cell samples. Here, we developed a new computational tool, CTAT-LR-Fusion, to detect fusion transcripts from long-read RNA-seq with or without companion short reads, with applications to bulk or single-cell transcriptomes. We demonstrate that CTAT-LR-Fusion exceeds the fusion detection accuracy of alternative methods as benchmarked with simulated and genuine long-read RNA-seq. Using short- and long-read RNA-seq, we further apply CTAT-LR-Fusion to bulk transcriptomes of nine tumor cell lines and to tumor single cells derived from a melanoma sample and three metastatic high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma samples. In both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, long isoform reads yield higher sensitivity for fusion detection than short reads with notable exceptions. By combining short and long reads in CTAT-LR-Fusion, we are able to further maximize the detection of fusion splicing isoforms and fusion-expressing tumor cells.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA is a promising new biomarker to manage and predict clinical outcomes of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection. However, the HBV serum transcriptome within encapsidated particles, which is the biomarker analyte measured in serum, remains poorly characterized. This study aimed to evaluate serum HBV RNA transcript composition and proportionality by PCR-cDNA nanopore sequencing of samples from CHB patients having varied HBV genotype (gt, A to F) and HBeAg status.
            
            
              Methods
              Longitudinal specimens from 3 individuals during and following pregnancy (approximately 7 months between time points) were also investigated. HBV RNA extracted from 16 serum samples obtained from 13 patients (73.3\% female, 84.6\% Asian) was sequenced and serum HBV RNA isoform detection and quantification were performed using three bioinformatic workflows; FLAIR, RATTLE, and a GraphMap-based workflow within the Galaxy application. A spike-in RNA variant (SIRV) control mix was used to assess run quality and coverage. The proportionality of transcript isoforms was based on total HBV reads determined by each workflow.
            
            
              Results
              All chosen isoform detection workflows showed high agreement in transcript proportionality and composition for most samples. HBV pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) was the most frequently observed transcript isoform (93.8\% of patient samples), while other detected transcripts included pgRNA spliced variants, 3′ truncated variants and HBx mRNA, depending on the isoform detection method. Spliced variants of pgRNA were primarily observed in HBV gtB, C, E, or F-infected patients, with the Sp1 spliced variant detected most frequently. Twelve other pgRNA spliced variant transcripts were identified, including 3 previously unidentified transcripts, although spliced isoform identification was very dependent on the workflow used to analyze sequence data. Longitudinal sampling among pregnant and post-partum antiviral-treated individuals showed increasing proportions of 3′ truncated pgRNA variants over time.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study demonstrated long-read sequencing as a promising tool for the characterization of the serum HBV transcriptome. However, further studies are needed to better understand how serum HBV RNA isoform type and proportion are linked to CHB disease progression and antiviral treatment response.},
